Starter File for Gulp workflow
====================

This is my personal gulp file that I use for the basis of most of my client projects. It includes gulp steps for compiling SASS and JS, compressing images through imagemin and live updating with browserSync. It also contains the basic underlying structure of my personal CSS Framework Potion (www.getpotion.com), that I have been using for some time. Eventually these two will be further melded together and this will serve as the new Potion framework moving forward.
