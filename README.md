Starter File for Gulp workflow
====================

This is my personal gulp file that I use as the starting point for most of my personal and client projects. It includes gulp steps for compiling SASS and JS, compressing images through imagemin and live updating with browserSync. It also contains the basic underlying structure of my personal CSS Framework Potion (www.getpotion.com), that I have been building upon for several years. Eventually these two will be further melded together and this repo will serve as the new Potion framework moving forward.
