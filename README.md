Potion
====================

A gulp.js workflow that uses my personal CSS framework Potion as the underlying architecture
---------------------

This is my personal gulp file that I use as the starting point for most of my personal and client projects. It includes gulp functions for compiling SASS and javascript, compressing images through imagemin and live updating with browserSync. It also contains the basic underlying structure of my personal CSS Framework Potion (www.getpotion.com) that I have been building upon for several years. This repo will serve as the new Potion framework moving forward and is meant to be more of a CSS plugin and organization system than yet another Bootstrap or Foundation.
