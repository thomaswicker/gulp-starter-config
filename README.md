Starter File for Gulp workflow
====================

This is my personal gulp file I use for the basis of all most projects. It includes gulp steps for compiling SASS and JS, compressing images through imagemin and live updates with browserSync. It also contains the basic structure of my personal CSS Framework Potion (www.getpotion.com), that I have been using for some time.
